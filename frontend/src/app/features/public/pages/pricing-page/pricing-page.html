  <h1>Pricing & Fees</h1>
  <p>
    UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL uses a simple, transaction-based pricing model. A platform fee is applied to each payment, and
    the net payout is released to the supplier once work is completed.

      <h2>Platform Fee</h2>
      <p>
        The standard UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL fee is <strong>7% of the member’s payment</strong>. This fee supports platform
        operations, compliance checks, secure escrow, and transaction monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining 93% is available as the supplier’s gross payout, subject to any tax or other charges
        applicable on their side.

      <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        If a member approves a payment of R100,000 for a contract, UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL applies a 7% fee (R7,000) and the
        supplier’s gross payout is R93,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fee is calculated automatically within the escrow process, so both parties always see the
        breakdown before approval.

      </div>
      <h2>Who Pays What</h2>
      <p>
        The member funds the full contract amount into escrow. The platform fee is deducted as part of the
        transaction, and net funds are released to the supplier on completion or agreed milestones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ensures clarity for members on total cost, and predictability for suppliers on expected net
        receipts.

      <h2>Value for Members</h2>
      <p>
        The platform fee includes access to competitive bidding, compliance checks, audit trails, and
        dispute reduction, helping members de-risk procurement decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members benefit from transparent supplier comparisons and structured workflows without needing to
        build this capability internally.

      <h2>Value for Suppliers</h2>
      <p>
        Suppliers gain access to qualified, verified demand, faster award decisions, and escrow-backed
        payments that reduce payment risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single, predictable fee structure makes it easier to price contracts and forecast revenue.
