    <h1>Pricing & Fees</h1>
    <p>
      UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL uses a simple, transaction-based pricing model. A platform fee is applied to each payment, and
      the net payout is released to the supplier once work is completed.
    </p>

        <h2>Platform Fee</h2>
        <p>
          The standard UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL fee is <strong>7% of the member’s payment</strong>. This fee supports platform
          operations, compliance checks, secure escrow, and transaction monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining 93% is available as the supplier’s gross payout, subject to any tax or other charges
          applicable on their side.

      <!-- Example Scenario -->

        </div>
        <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          If a member approves a payment of <strong>R100,000</strong> for a contract, UKHUSELO SUPPLIER PORTAL applies a 7% fee (<strong>R7,000</strong>) and the
          supplier’s gross payout is <strong>R93,000</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fee is calculated automatically within the escrow process, so both parties always see the
          breakdown before approval.

      <!-- Who Pays What -->
      <article class="pricing-card">
        <div class="pricing-icon">
          <i class="bi bi-cash-coin"></i>
        </div>
        <h2>Who Pays What</h2>
        <p>
          The member funds the full contract amount into escrow. The platform fee is deducted as part of the
          transaction, and net funds are released to the supplier on completion or agreed milestones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures clarity for members on total cost, and predictability for suppliers on expected net
          receipts.

          dispute reduction, helping members de-risk procurement decisions.

        <p>

        <h2>Value for Suppliers</h2>
