    payments and built-in compliance.

      <h2>1. Member Onboarding & Requirement Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Verified members log into the platform and complete a structured request form describing what they
        need. Requests can cover services or products such as uniforms, SIM cards, access control systems,
        patrol monitoring, two-way radios, financial assistance, or insurance solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The member selects a category, quantity, delivery timelines, and a budget range, then submits the
        request to the marketplace. The request becomes visible for relevant suppliers to engage.

      <h2>2. Supplier Notification & Bidding</h2>
      <p>
        Registered suppliers in the selected category automatically receive notifications when a new
        request matches their offering. They review the requirements and submit structured bids directly on
        the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bid typically includes pricing, product or service specifications, delivery timelines, and,
        where required, compliance credentials. Suppliers can attach supporting documents or product
        catalogues to strengthen their proposals.

      <h2>3. Bid Evaluation & Supplier Selection</h2>
      <p>
        Members compare all bids within a standardised comparison interface. The platform displays key
        supplier information including compliance status, industry credentials, and, where available, past
        transaction history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on price, quality, service offering, and credibility, the member selects the preferred
        supplier. Once awarded, the system digitally connects both parties and moves the job to the next
        stage.

      <h2>4. Compliance & Trade Verification</h2>
      <p>
        Before any funds move, the platform performs verification checks to ensure trade eligibility.
        This includes confirming that supplier credentials are valid and up to date, that the member is in
        good standing, that payment methods or financial capacity are confirmed, and that all required
        compliance documentation has been verified.
      </p>
      <p>Only verified parties are allowed to proceed with the transaction.</p>

      <h2>5. Transaction Monitoring & Payment Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed via a secure, integrated gateway. Funds are held in escrow until service
        delivery or agreed milestones are completed. The platform automatically deducts any facilitation
        fees (where applicable) and releases the remaining funds to the supplier when the job is completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every transaction generates a full audit trail, with receipts and reports available to both
        parties. This provides transparency, reduces disputes, and supports revenue accountability and
        governance.
