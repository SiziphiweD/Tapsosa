      <h2>Payments & Fees</h2>
      <h3>How does escrow work?</h3>

        Members fund payments into escrow via the integrated gateway. Funds are held until delivery or
        milestones are confirmed, then released to the supplier.
      </p>
      <h3>What fees apply?</h3>
      <p>
        A standard platform fee is applied to the member’s payment. The net payout goes to the supplier.
        See the Pricing page for a full breakdown and examples.
